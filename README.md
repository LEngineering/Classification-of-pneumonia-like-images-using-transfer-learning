# Classification of pneumonia-like images using transfer learning 
Transfer learning using VGG16, Keras and TensorFlow to detect pneumonia-like X-ray images.

## Dataset

<div align=center><img width="500" src="./images/pneumon-normal.PNG"/></div>

The input data is fed into the model using 220 chest X-ray images taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) where 110 labeled normal and 110 labeled with pneumonia to output the probability of each thoracic disease.

We reserved 80% of the data for training (20% of 80% for validation) and 20% for testing:

For this network we used VGG16 and built new FC layers for our model:

## Results 
The tendency for training and validation loss is to drop to a close value to '0' whereas the training and validation accuracy is to approach to the value of '1'/ 100%. 
As we can see our model is not overfitting despite the number of images we input and we obtained an accuracy of 95%.

To evaluate classifier output quality we also achieved a larger area under the curve (AUC=0.99):

We can also visualize the performance of the algorithm by computing the confusion matrix:

We notice that the model doesn't detect any False Negative test result.
